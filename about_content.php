       <h1>About Southern Knights Cruisers</h1>
        <p>The Southern Knights Cruisers is a Non-profit Club under IRS Section 501 (c) 7 formed in 2004 by local car hobbyists who enjoy showing and driving their old cars and who are dedicated to raising money to help veterans through the enjoyment of the hobby.</p>

        <h2>2014 Car Show</h2>
        <p>Thank you for joining us for the 15th Annual Southern Knights Cruisers Veterans Car and Bike Show.The Show was an overwhelming success.  There were over 300 vehicles and 50 vendors.  The Show was able to raise $24,600 that was donated to our military veterans. With this yearâ€™s donations, gives us a total of $308,000 that has been raised with this Show.  The Club believes that with the date change of the Show to October helped with the success.  Wait till this year, the Show is only going to get better.</p><br/>

        <h2>2015 Car Show</h2>
        <p>Plans are in the making of an even bigger show in 2015. Again, this year the 16th Annual Southern Knights Cruisers Veterans Car &amp; Bike Show will be saluting and honoring our country's veterans. Money that is raised will benefit the Virginia Wounded Warrior Program, the Fisher House, and McGuire Veterans Hospital. We expect that there will be even more interest in the Show this year given the response we had last year...more to come on displays and vendors. </p>
